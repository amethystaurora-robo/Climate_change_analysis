### Climate Change Tipping Points Analysis

This is an exploratory analysis I conducted for a PhD interview on climate tipping points. (I was not successful in the interview ðŸ˜©)

From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Wesbite (NOAA), I downloaded two datasets. One was on average global sea surface temperature, and another was on bivalve (*Arctica islandica*) growth rates.

Both of these can be used as indications of overall ocean health, and significant trends can even point to an early warning indicator of a climate tipping point AKA a point of no return for the climate. Think when Greenland's ice sheet reaches a point of melting that it cannot recover, or the point at which coral bleaching is so extreme that coral reefs will never come back. Really riveting stuff. (Kind of like my attempt to find a PhD supervisor ðŸ˜©)

The Subpolar Gyre is another area where climate tipping points are being studied. A collapse of the Subpolar Gyre could have implications on weather, sea levls, and global ocean circulation.

The first worksheet takes a look at average sea surface temperature in each area in the Subpolar Gyre. When I super-imposed the warm and cold currents on top of the area, I was able to find a trend.

The first trend shows that the region in the Labrador Current has shown warming since 1992. This assessment is backed up by current literature, citing the movement of the Gulf Stream northward as a reason for warmer water being pushed into the Labrador Current area, and changing the structure of the Subpolar Gyre.

The third and final sheet took a quick look at changes in growth rates for the bivalves *Arctica islandica*. 29 organisms were obtained off the coast of Iceland, and their growth rings were measured (similar to how tree rings are measured each year). Slowing or disruptions in growth rates for bivalves is a good indicator of ocean temperatures and acidification levels. In this case, there has been an overall slowing of growth since 1980.
