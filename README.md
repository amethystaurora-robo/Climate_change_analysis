This is an exploratory analysis I conducted for a PhD interview on climate tipping points. (I was not successful in the interview :'))
From the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Wesbite (NOAA), I downloaded two datasets. One was on average global sea surface temperature, and another was on bivalve (*Arctica islandica*) growth rates.
Both of these can be used as indications of overall ocean health, and significant trends can even point to an early warning indicator of a climate tipping point (A point of no return for the climate)
